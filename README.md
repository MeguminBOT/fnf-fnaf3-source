# Official source code of VS FNaF 3.
** This is the android variants source **

Mod is running on a modified Psych Engine 0.6.2 version.
Source released to comply with the open source requirement 

(PORTS OF VS FNAF 3 ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO BE OPENSOURCED, SINCE PEOPLE APPARENTLY DONT UNDERSTAND THIS, I WILL SADLY HAVE TO TAKE MEASURES AGAINST THOSE WHO DON'T RELEASE THEIR PORTS SOURCE)

## About ports
Please refrain from doing unofficial mod folder ports for at least 2 months. Doing it for private use is totally fine, but wait a bit with the public.
Regarding HTML ports, message @AutisticLulu on Discord if you want to help with making an official HTML build, I have the resources to host the game as a website on my server as well.

Android Build and Linux build is currently in the works by me.

Official Mac/OSX builds will be supplied by: [JonnycatMeow](https://github.com/JonnycatMeow)
